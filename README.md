# Gas Optimisation Challenges
June 19, 2023
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now you’ve learnt about gas optimisation, it’s time to put your knowledge to test! 

The following are four smart contracts which are inefficient and require improvements for gas optimisation.

Among the challenges, there’s:

- A contract for simple auction, 
- An interface for batch signature and transfer, 
- A smart contract for purchase status tracking and finally,
- A smart contract for voting.
